I am a 3rd year PhD student in Grenoble-Alpes University.
I develop new methods for imputation of missing data in high-dimensional proteomics datasets, with transcriptomics integration.
I also collaborate on a project for proteomic biomarkor discovery, led by David PÃ©rez, a PhD student from [EDyP Lab](http://www.edyp.fr/web/).
I am interested in machine learning, statistical tools and concepts that enable to extract knowledge from large omics datasets.

My thesis is supervised by [Thomas Burger](https://sites.google.com/site/thomasburgerswebpage) from [EDyP Lab](http://www.edyp.fr/web/) and [Nelle Varoquaux](https://nellev.github.io/) from TIMC, [TrEE@CompBio](https://tree-timc.github.io/compbio/) group.
