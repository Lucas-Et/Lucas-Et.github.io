I am a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley, Department of Statistics, in Elizabeth Purdom's Group since January 2025 and until January 2027. 
Originally from the southwest of France (Saint-Michel-De-Double, Dordogne), I did a "classe préparatoire" in Bordeaux (La Prépa des INP), to then integrate an engineering school in Grenoble specialized in computer science and applied mathematics (Ensimag).
Finally, I got my PhD at Université Grenoble-Alpes in statistical proteomics, supervised by [Thomas Burger](https://sites.google.com/site/thomasburgerswebpage) from [EDyP Lab](http://www.edyp.fr/web/) and [Nelle Varoquaux](https://nellev.github.io/) from TIMC, [TrEE@CompBio](https://tree-timc.github.io/compbio/) group.
Besides my research, I explore what the Bay Area has the best to offer. I love plenty of different sports (football, volleyball ...) and outside activities (snowboard, rock climbing, sailing ...) as well as listening to electronic music and playing a bit of piano. 

## My research journey

During my PhD, I developed novel methods for the imputation of missing data in high-dimensional proteomics datasets, that can leverage transcriptomics data. 
One of the challenges was that missing values in proteomics are often classified as Missing Not at Random (MNAR), meaning their likelihood of being missing depends on the unobserved data itself.
In this context, it means that the lower the values is, the likelier it is to be missing, which makes them even harder to infer. 
Also, the huge dimensionality of proteomics datasets really hampers multivariate approaches.
I was also involved in an applied project that aimed at building a biomarker panel for disease severity prediction.

I am now focusing on new statistical methods for single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. 
In particular, I am interested in differential expression analysis across multiple conditions in the setting where cell types are not defined, focusing on statistical correctness of such procedure as well as its interpretability.
On top of that, I intervene in the analysis of experimental data, about neuronal cell differentiation in a joint project with the NIH.

## Commitment to diffusion of science

During the two first years of my PhD, I launched and was in charge of the MIAI PhD club.
The [MIAI](https://miai.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) is an institute in Grenoble that funds PhD thesis related to Data Science and AI.
I co-organised two [workshops on AI](https://miai.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/3ia-doctoral-workshop-2021-867574.kjsp) that brought together PhD Students from all the [AI institutes in France](https://instituts-3ia.fr/), and some [presentations/lunch sessions](https://miai.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/save-the-date-miai-phd-club-5-min-papers--874403.kjsp) for MIAI PhD students.
I also gave tutorials in mathematics and statistics at Université Grenoble-Alpes and at Ensimag.
